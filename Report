Dear Sir, my name is Himanshu Malik, and I am writing to get an APS certificate. I have already couriered the paperwork to the delivery location. However, I have not received any update from your side. And Sir, because the website is down, I am unable to monitor the status of my application.

Sir, I received my offer letter from my esteemed university, GISMA Business School, and my classes begin on January 9, 2023. Sir, I don't have enough time since I also need to apply for my Visa, and I'm impatiently awaiting for APS certificate.

Sir, it would be greatly appreciated if you could please speed the procedure and provide meÂ my APS Certificate as soon as possible.

My APS application details :-
My Unique token number : 216691026872690

Waiting for your great response.

Thank You
Yours FaithFully
Himanshu Malik
